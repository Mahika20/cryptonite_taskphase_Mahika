## Challenge 1: Cat not the pet but the command
In this challenge, I had to use the cat command to read the flag in the home directory. Since I was already in the home directory, I ran the command cat flag and received the flag.

## Challenge 2: Catting absolute paths
For this challenge I used the command cat /flag to read the flag with cat at its absolute path /flag.

## Challenge 3: More catting practice
This challenge required us to retrieve the flag, hidden in a different directory, by the absolute path. The absolute path of the file was provided in the instructions in terminal. I used the command 
'''cat /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcanberra-0.30/flag''' 
to retrieve the flag.

## Challenge 8: Hidden files
This challenge required us to find the hidden flag file in /. I ran the command cd / to access / directory. In order to view all the files, including the hidden ones, I ran the command ls ~a. There I found the dot-prepended flag file -> /.flag-19271559011509. Then to receive the flag, I ran the command 
'''grep pwn.college /.flag-19271559011509'''
