# Module 5:File_Globbing
## Challenge 1: Matching with *
This challenge required us to change our directory to /challenge, but use globbing to keep the argument we pass to cd to at most four characters.
So, I ran the command `cd /ch*` as ch* would match the pattern of challenge. Then I ran the command `/challenge/run` to retrieve the flag.
