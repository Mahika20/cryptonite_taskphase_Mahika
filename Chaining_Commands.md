# Module 11: Chaining Commands
## Challenge 1: Chaining with semicolons
This challenge required us to run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, chaining them with a semicolon. I ran the command `/challenge/pwn;/challenge/college` to chain the two commands using a semicolon. Here, semicolon allows us to write two commands before anything is executed. This step yielded the flag.
```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn;/challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8WHe3oPV7gzZmkfo72tv8URSBoG.dVTN4QDL1YTN0czW}
```
Flag link: pwn.college{8WHe3oPV7gzZmkfo72tv8URSBoG.dVTN4QDL1YTN0czW}
